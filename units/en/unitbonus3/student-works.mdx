# Student Works

Since the launch of the Deep Reinforcement Learning Course, **many students have created amazing projects that you should check out and consider participating in**.

If you've created an interesting project, don't hesitate to [add it to this list by opening a pull request on the GitHub repository](https://github.com/huggingface/deep-rl-class).

The projects are **arranged based on the date of publication in this page**.


## Space Scavanger AI

This project is a space game environment with trained neural network for AI.

AI is trained by Reinforcement learning algorithm based on UnityMLAgents and RLlib frameworks.

In this project, Eric Dong recreates Bill Seiler's 1985 version of Space War in Pygame and uses reinforcement learning (RL) to train AI agents.

This project is currently in development!

## Decision Transformers for Trading

In this project, student has explored training a Decision Transformer for stock trading. In phase-1, offline training has been implemented. He intends to incorporate online fine-tuning in the next version.
